History

The Cherubim and Seraphim Church (C&S) is the first African Pentecostal church  known as the (ALADURA CHURCH)  was founded in Nigeria in the year 1925 by Saint Moses Orimolade Tunolase (1879-1933) born into the royal family of Ayibiri in Ikare, Ondo State of Nigeria.
How it all started..

Orimolade started his missionary work as an itinerant preacher in Ikare (his Yoruba town of birth) with no formal education. After his baptism by Rev. Ganyes in 1912, he started to evangelise and pray for people, from where he got the nickname “Baba Aladura” (Praying Father), which is still used to identify the head of the C & S sect.

He openly confronted witches and wizards in Irun (another Yoruba town) and pulled down the image of Osijora, one of the idols worshipped in the village. He condemned the prevalent practice of human sacrifice in Benin City. He consecrated a pool in Kaba town and rid it of the evil spirit the villagers had worshipped. Orimolade converted many to the Christian faith. Traditional worshippers willingly gave up their charms and images for burning in response to his preaching and prayer. He directed his converts to the existing churches, irrespective of denominations, and where no church existed he helped establish one. Some of the churches established by Orimolade were actually established for the Church Missionary Society.

As time went by, a lot of people were interested in his ministry, and from the miracles witnessed by various towns in the Western regions, (Ilesha, Ikare, Ilorin, Lokoja ) which lead to Orimolade gaining followers. Some of his major priorities were the reading of the Bible, the efficacy of prayer, the power of miracles, and the cultivation of a Christ-like behaviour.

In 1925, while watching a Catholic Corpus Christi procession, Captain Emanuel Abiodun then a teenager reportedly fell into a lengthy trance. She only awoke from her trance after the healer Moses Orimolade arrived to pray for her after various ministers have failed to wake her up. On waking, Captain Emanuel said she had been visited by angels who had taken her to heaven.  Increasing numbers of visitors came to hear of her visions  In the year 1925 Baba Orimolade founded the Cherubim and Seraphim with Captain Emanuel Abiodun led an evangelical tour of Western Nigeria, condemning the worship of traditional gods and encouraging Christian prayer.
